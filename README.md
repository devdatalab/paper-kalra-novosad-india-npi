# Impacts of regional lockdown policies on COVID-19 transmission in India in 2020


#Details

Do lockdowns and mobility restrictions contain the spread of COVID-19? We collected data on district-level non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), using government notifications and news reports, in six major Indian states to assess the impact of NPIs on COVID transmission and fatality in 2020. We find that NPIs slowed COVID death rates in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. Interventions that were most associated with slowing fatalities were temple closures, retail closures, and curfews. These findings are important, as a third wave is imminent in India, and state governments are discussing the costs and benefits of restrictions on social behavior.
